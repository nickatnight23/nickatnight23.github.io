I decided to learn software engineering because I have always been passionate about technology. I remember my early experiences with technology. I played Oregon trail when I was in kindergarten and fell in love with playing with something on a screen.  I played a Sega Genesis, Gameboy and Nintendo. I am a huge Mario fan. I loved having the latest technologies and have always been moved by robotics. I want to create something that is very helpful and useful and understand how it works.
I am in my mid-thirties and have been trying to find myself after I finished my basketball journey in college. I pursued a career in becoming a law enforcement officer. After being told No for about 5 years I thought that maybe being an officer was not in the cards for me. In the quest of continuing to try to pursue a career in law, I began journeying the path of a paralegal. I graduated June 2019 with my paralegal certification. Just imagine what my family and friends are thinking now that I am in a coding bootcamp.
Which brings me to here and now. Throughout those years I have always thought about a career in technology.  I changed my major from computer information systems to political science and I do not regret that choice. Especially after reading stories about the way the curriculum is taught in traditional schools. I believe becoming a Software Engineer requires a lot of hands on experience. I believe colleges teaches more on theory then actual practical experience that you will need on the job.
I bought books on different coding languages such as Python and tried to teach myself by reading the material. I really was not getting anywhere. I then started doing some research and stumbled a cross Career Karma. Shout out to career Karma community. The 21-day challenge was very helpful in pushing me towards going after my dreams and not letting anything stand in the way.
Ultimately, I decided to learn software engineering because I have a passion for technology, and I want to create cool and exciting programs. I also want to be able to help people with their businesses and improve processes, making things a lot easier. I also love the fact that you will never stop learning, there is always something new to learn. I just canâ€™t wait to be at a higher level of understanding code. I will say I was really stuck on learning Python, but now that I have been experiencing with Ruby, I am open to learning programing languages of all kinds.
