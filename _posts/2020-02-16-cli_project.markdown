This project has opened my eyes to a better understanding of what being a software engineer consists of. I am learning how to read errors in code and how to look up information in order to fix errors. These skills that I am learning has really been teaching me about patience’s and that new errors are good!

I decided to do my project on zodiac signs, since I find it interesting. We had two options regarding how to get the information from a website and that was scrubbing or using an API. I initially decided to scrub, shortly after I decided to use an API, then I went right back to scrubbing lol, since astrology does not have any free API resources.  Scrapping seemed to be more straight forward to me. Though, it is tricky because you must make sure that you are grabbing the right tag in order to get the right information that you need. This also got me more familiar with the capabilities of pry. I learned that it can be life saver because it breaks down the information you grabbed from the site.

When I started this project, we were still using the IDE with sandbox. I decided to rip the band- aid off and learn how to use a local environment. That was hard, but it taught me to stick it out and eventually I will begin to understand the local environment. The text editor that I started using is called vs code. I still have more to learn about how the text editor functions, but I have the basic functions down and with time I will be able to use more of the advance functions. I can’t wait!

The CLI project itself was hard. Once I got my environment setup and I was able to focus on the project. I thought I had a good understanding of what to do, that slowly changed. I struggled with adding gems to my windows computer and had to go through a lot of debugging. Stubbing the project out was cool, the hard part came when you had to get the information from the web to work with the classes that you created. Mind twisting! There were concepts I thought I understood about Ruby, but really didn’t and I really had to do a lot of re- reading of material and get support from my cohort. What I learned was I will not survive in this program without the support of my cohort! I also learned that we are all capable of doing things we may think that we can’t! I know I have more to understand about Ruby and coding in general, but I look forward to learning every day!

Happy coding!
