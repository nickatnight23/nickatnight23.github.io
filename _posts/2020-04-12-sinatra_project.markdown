 I decided to build a gratitude app. I have had challenges while building the application. The challenges were learning how to read errors and use the errors to determine where the issue was in the application. This application had a lot more layers in order to get the app up and running compared to the CLI project.

Since, I like writing daily gratitude entries I thought creating an app would be cool. This app was built using CRUD which stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. The gratitude app allows users to log in, sign up, create entries as well as edit and delete the entry that belongs to the current user that is logged in. 

The gratitude app is very simple, but I wanted to make sure that I understood all the key concepts. I think if I would have created something more complex, it would have been more of struggle for me. Even though its simple I had to bring together all the key concepts that was taught such as Active record, Rack, Sinatra, and much more. Understanding how we interact with the browser as a user through get and post request was very informative. It was challenging starting the project, but for me starting the project early and giving myself plenty of time to work on it took away some of the pressure.

I am happy that I was able to complete the project. This project really gave me a better understanding of how the web works using Sinatra. This was a huge milestone for me. A few months ago I did not know much about coding, let alone being able to build something that a user can interact with. This has been challenging, yet amazing.

Happy coding!
