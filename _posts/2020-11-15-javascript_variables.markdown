JavaScript has been a journey for me. The more time that I spend with JavaScript I realize certain concepts that I previously did not understand was clicking for me. Also, sometimes just revisiting a topic or seeing various examples of a concept helps with the understanding process. I know that I have a long way to go with JavaScript, there are so many moving parts, but I believe understanding the basics paves a smooth path for learning more complex concepts. Therefore, I decided to talk about variables.

**Var** **let** and **const** are three commonly used variables in JavaScript. There is some information that needs to be known about them and how they function in JavaScript. **var** is the oldest out of the group and though you can still use it, it is best practice not to.

The reason being is because of a term called scope. In JavaScript before ES2015 there were types of scope, local scope and global scope. ES2015 brought in block scope with const and let.

Global scope is found outside of a function

which means that it is accessible to everything
 The reason that **var** is a tricky variable to use is because it is more prone to errors and it is very easy to override previous written code. This is where the keywords **const** and **let** come in. These variables provide block scope, in which variables declared with the keyword var does not have block scope. Currently, with JavaScript it is best practice to use **const** and **let**.

This is an example of understanding the basics of a particular concept. I think breaking things down into baby steps helps a lot. JavaScript has a lot of moving parts, so it best to understand the fundamentals.![](![(http://)
